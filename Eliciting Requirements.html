    <p><span class="firstterm">Eliciting requirements</span> is the process of determining what the customers actually need a proposed system to do and of documenting that information in a way that will allow us to write a more formal requirements document later.</p>
    <p>In this lecture we survey some key concepts, problems, and actitivies associated with requirements elicitation, and then look at <span class="firstterm">use cases</span>, one of the most popular ways of documenting our understanding of those requirements.</p>

    </li>
  <li>

</ul><hr/><p><strong>Problems of requirements analysis</strong></p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stakeholders don’t know what they really want</p>
    
    <p>(Is this a real problem, or snobbery on the part of software developers? For as often as I see this “problem” listed, I’m never really sure.)</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms</p>
    </li>
  <li>Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements</li>
  <li>Organizational and political factors may influence the system requirements</li>
  <li>The requirements may change during the analysis process.</li>
  <li>New stakeholders may emerge</li>
</ul><a id="elicitingrequirements"/><h1 id="eliciting-requirements">2 Eliciting Requirements</h1><p>The process of <span class="firstterm">eliciting requirements</span> is, fundamentally, an exercise in communication between developers and stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Interviewing the stakeholders…</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>Facilitated meetings</p>

  </li>
</ul><h2 id="interviews">3.1 Interviews</h2><ul>
  <li>
    <p>Interviews may focus on general questions, e.g.,</p>
    
    <p>“What do you do? ”What information do you need to do your job?“, ”What problems are you encountering with the current system?"</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or may seek to elicit scenarios</p>
    
    <p>“Walk me through the process you follow when X happens.”</p>
    
  </li>
</ul><p>These interviews can be as much about learning how the current system works as about what is desired from the new system.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>That’s consistent with object-oriented approaches where a <em>domain model</em> is  constructed of how the system works now, and that model is  gradually <em>evolved</em> into an <em>analysis model</em> of how we would  like it to work in the future,
    <ul>
      <li>including the possible automation of processes currently done  manually.</li>
      <li>OO practice assumes that the structure of the new system will  mirror the structure of the old one to a significant degree, so  effort spent modeling the current world is also effort towards  modeling the new system.</li>

  <p>2: The proctor provides the candidate with a copy of the  assessment and an empty response document.</p>
    
  <p>3: The proctor authorizes the start of the assessment  session.</p>
    
  <p>4: The candidate reads the assessment, and repeatedly  selects items from it. For each selected item, the candidate  creates a response, adding it to the response document.</p>
    
  <p>5: The proctor ends the assessment session after time has  expired.</p>

  <p>2: The candidate brings blank sheets of paper or blue books  to serve as the response document.</p>
    
  <p><strong>Candidate finishes early</strong></p>
    
  <p>5: The candidate indicates that he/she is finished prior to  the end of the allotted time. The proctor ends the assessment  session.</p>
    
  <p><strong>Suspended session</strong></p>
    
  <p>5: The candidate asks to suspend the session, with the intention of  completing the assessment at a later date. The proctor determines  from the assessment properties that this is acceptable.</p>

</blockquote><p>In pre-OO, Waterfall and similar processes, at the end of each phase, we set aside the prior set of documentation and sit with blank sheets of paper to begin the next phase “fresh”.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>The records of elicited requirements information serve as <em>references</em> when we start writing the requirements documents.</p>

  <p>The design documents serve as <em>references</em> when we start writing the code.</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>But each new step is, in essence, a fresh start.</p>
    <p>There’s a certain wisdom in this. There’s a real danger in making design decisions when writing early requirements, or in having people reading the requirements <em>think</em> that you made a design decision when choosing notations or writing explanations as part of the requirements.</p>
    <p>A fresh start helps remind designers that they have the freedom, if not the obligation, to consider alternatives.</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>Evolution</strong></p>
    <p>But the OO view is very different. If we buy into the OO philosophy, then we take a more evolutionary process.</p>
    <p>OOA is largely viewed as a model-building activity:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Start with a model of how the world works now.</li>
  <li>Make just enough changes to that model to explain what we want to  change (e.g., via new automation).</li>
  <li>Make just enough additional changes to account for necessary design  “compromises”.</li>
</ul><p>The result is, eventually, a design that had clear ties to the original model of the world before we started our project.</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>Model Building</strong></p>
    <p>The primary models of Object Oriented Analysis and Design are:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>domain model</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>analysis model</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>design model</p>
    </li>
</ul><a id="domainmodels"/><h3 id="domain-models">4.3.1 Domain Models</h3><p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="domainModel.png" style="float: right; max-width: 50%;"/></p>
    <p>A <span class="firstterm">domain model</span> is a model of the application domain as it currently exists, <span class="emph">before</span> we began our new development project. The point of the domain model is to be sure the development team understands the world that the system will work in.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>The domain model describes the world in terms of objects interacting with one another via messages.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not every project needs a domain model</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>e.g., If the team has done  several projects already in this application domain, they may  already share a common domain model.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><p>(Fortunately, most companies work in a small number of application domains. If they hired you last month to develop software for analyzing seismic data for petroleum engineering, they are unlikely to ask you to develop a compiler or a word processor next month.)</p>
    <p>In that case, the team may already have a good understanding of the domain.</p>
    <p>Even if a document describing the domain model is desired, domain models tend to be highly reusable since the world around our software systems usually changes fairly slowly.</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>Interacting Objects</strong></p>
    <p>All OOA models are based on the concept of objects interacting with one another by the exchange of messages (function calls).</p>
    <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="domainModel.png" style="float: right; max-width: 40%;"/></p>
    <p>Hence, even if we are modeling a physical object or a human being, we write our models in terms of classes with an interface of <span class="firstterm">attributes</span> and <span class="firstterm">operations</span>.</p>
    <p>E.g.,</p>
    <table border="1"><tr><th>Transaction</th></tr><tr><td>
date  <br/>

relatedAccount  <br/>
amount
</td></tr><tr><td>
apply(toBalance)
</td></tr></table><table border="1"><tr><th>Checkbook</th></tr><tr><td>

list of Transactions <br/>
</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr></table><a id="analysismodels"/><h3 id="analysis-models">4.3.2 Analysis Models</h3><p>An <span class="firstterm">analysis model</span> is a model of how the  world will interact with the software system that we envision. As such,  it is our statement of just <span class="emph">what</span> the system will do  when it is working.</p>
    <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="analysisModel1.png" style="float: right; max-width: 50%;"/></p>
    <p>There is a real temptation to simply assume that the automated  system will simply squat in the middle of the world, interacting with  all the real world objects, sort of like this:</p>
    <p>Or if you prefer,…</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>It’s Magic!</strong></p>
    <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="analysisModel2.png" style="float: right; max-width: 50%;"/></p>
    <p>Poof! We have an analysis model!</p>
    <p>Not wrong, per se, but it’s certainly not helpful. </p>
    <p>Such an approach is fundamentally at odds with the OO philosophy, though.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>We should look to the real world to suggest how to decompose our system.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, we have not decomposed it at all – just wrapped it up into a single black box.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>All the hard decisions still need to be made.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <p>And we have thrown out any insight we gained from building our  domain model.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><p>In essence we have not done any analysis at all here. This “model” isn’t <span class="emph">wrong</span>, per se, but it’s certainly not helpful. We’ve basically thrown away everything we’ve learned in the domain model about how objects really interact. We’re treating the new program as a simple box, with no knowledge of its internal structure, Essentially, we’ve just deferred all the hard questions to the upcoming design.</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>Evolving the Analysis Model</strong></p>
    <p>What we really hope for is an <span class="emph">evolution</span> from our domain model to our analysis model. The OO philosophy tells us that the classes and interactions of our domain model …</p>
    <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="domainModel.png" style="float: left; max-width:  50%;"/></p>
    <p>… should carry over into our analysis. </p>
    <p>In essence, we hope to retain these classes, add more detail to our understanding of them, and to establish a boundary that tells us which of these classes and behaviors will be automated, which will remain entirely unautomated, and which will have some portion automated while other parts remain external.</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>The Boundary</strong></p>
    <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="analysisBorders.png" style="float: right; max-width: 50%;"/></p>
    <p>… establish a boundary that tells us which of these classes and behaviors will</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>be automated</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>remain external</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>be a mixture of the two</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>The system, then, remains a collection of interacting objects rather than an unstructured black box.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>We may need to modify our class interfaces to reflect our new  understanding, but we don’t need to discard them and start from scratch.</li>
</ul><p>There’s a definite overlap in the purpose of a requirements document and of an analysis model. Some will regard the analysis model as a kind of requirements specification. In some projects, though, a requirements document will still be required as something for customers or management to sign off on. But the analysis model is the basis from which the eventual requirements document is derived.</p>
    <p>The evolutionary approach will carry forward, in an OO-style project, from requirements into design. When building the <em>design model</em>, we will start with the classes (and their APIs/interfaces) and make merely the changes we deem necessary for an effective design.</p>
