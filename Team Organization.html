    <p>Development teams are organized to </p>
    <ul>
  <li>promote communication among the team members and between th team and  interested external parties</li>
  <li>match required skills against needs of the project</li>
  <li>enhance overall productivity of the team</li>
</ul><p>In this lesson, we look at some of these issues and at some common organizations that have been considered to deal with these.</p>
    <h1 id="issues">1 Issues</h1><p>Major issues in organizing a development team are</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Communication</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>maximize communication within the team</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <p>establish responsive communication points with stakeholders</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staffing </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>does the team contain all the skill sets reuqired to complete  the work?</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Productivity </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>are we making effective use of our team members’ skills?</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2 id="communications">1.1 Communications</h2><p>There are two key aspects here</p>
    <ul>
  <li>internal communications within the team</li>
  <li>external communications with interested parties</li>
</ul><a id="internalcommunications"/><h3 id="internal-communications">1.1.1 Internal Communications</h3><p><em>Brook’s law</em> is well-known truism of software development:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>"Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.  – Fred Brooks, _The Mythical Man-Month, 1975</p>
    
</blockquote><p>Why?</p>
    <p>Brooks argues that</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Complex projects cannot be decomposed into subprojects  that can be solved independently without communication.</li>
</ul><p>He suggests that partly, this is an attribute of the problem being solved.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Essential versus accidental complexity</p>
    
    <p>He suggests that sometimes we add complexity by our choices of process or design, but that some problems are just plain complicated. As a consequence, he suggests that there is an</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>irreducible number of errors
        <p>that we will always commit along the way, and that this is independent of the number of people we have working.</p>
    
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>But he also argues that</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More personnel implies more communications paths</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>$n$ staff have \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) potential communications paths.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><hr/><p><strong>Reducing Internal Communications Costs</strong></p>
    <p>Our options are limited</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Keep teams small, or</li>
  <li>Structure the teams in ways that facilitate the  most critical communications paths</li>
</ul><a id="externalcommunications"/><h3 id="external-communications">1.1.2 External Communications</h3><p>We can divide this into</p>
    <ul>
  <li>communications with the development team’s own management</li>
  <li>communications with the eventual users of the software</li>
</ul><p>Historically, the former has been emphasized</p>
    <ul>
  <li><em>visibility</em> of the process is a major factor in Waterfall &amp; Spiral</li>
</ul><p>Over time, more and more emphasis has shifted to communications with the users.</p>
    <hr/><p><strong>Users, Customers, and Stakeholders</strong></p>
    <p>“Users” is an incredibly vague, catch-all term that serves to hide as much as it reveals.</p>
    <p>Avoid it when possible.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="firstterm">Customers</span> are the people who have the authority to  accept or reject the system, to pay for it or not.</p>
    
    <p>“Pay” is not necessarily a simple monetary transaction.(e.g., internal projects)</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><span class="firstterm">Stakeholders</span> are the people with an interest in the  structure and behavior of the system.</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>A company’s upper-level management approves budget to develop a  system. They are the <em>customers</em>.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>The output of the system is a series of reports used on a monthly  basis by the company’s middle and low-level managers. They are  <em>stakeholders</em>, because they have an interest in the content and  format of those reports.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>Much of the input of the system will be supplied by the company’s  clerical staff, sales people, and technicians. They are also  <em>stakeholders</em>, because the system will directly impact their daily  jobs.</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>We look to customers for general guidelines on what will make the valuable and acceptable to them.</p>
    <p>We look to stakeholders for much of the insight into how the system needs to work.</p>
    <a id="generalorganizations"/><h1 id="general-organizations">2 General Organizations</h1><p>There are a few “obvious” ways to organize developers into a team.</p>
    <p>One might be the basic democracy (or anarchy) of everyone working as peers.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>You probably don’t need very large teams before this gets unwieldy.</li>
</ul><a id="hierarchicalteamorganization"/><h2 id="hierarchical-team-organization">2.1 Hierarchical Team Organization</h2><ul>
  <li>One team per major subsystem</li>
  <li>Teams report to managers</li>
  <li>Managers report to one or more levels of higher managers</li>
</ul><hr/><p><strong>Dangers of Hierarchical Teams</strong></p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Distance between teams (where real work is done) and higher mgmt may  hide problems.</p>
    
    <p>I like van Vliet’s example:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The following scenario is not entirely fictitious:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p>bottom: we have severe troubles in implementing module X;</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p>level 1: there are some problems with module X;</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p>level 2: progress is steady, I do not foresee any real problems;</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p>top: everything proceeds according to our plan."</p>
    </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level in hierarchy often equates with rank / rewards</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Engineers either cannot rise in level or are forced to abandon  their primary skills to be managers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><a id="matrixorganization"/><h2 id="matrix-organization">2.2 Matrix Organization</h2><ul>
  <li>Staff are assigned specialized roles based on skill sets
    <ul>
      <li>e.g., architects, designers, analysts, testers</li>
      <li>Team managers address general ability of team to perform role</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subprojects identify required role players

</table><p>Clearly this has limited benefit if an organization is so small that they have just one architect, one tester, …</p>
    <p>In this model, team members with critical skills can be swapped from project to project depending on where each project is within the SDPM. For example, a good architectural designer may leave projects once they enter the high-level design phase.</p>

    <p>Programming productivity studies have found that the “best” people in many organizations were orders of magnitude more productive than the average. (Not than the worst, but than the average.)</p>
    
    <p>Some of this correlates with varying degrees of experience, both in general and with the specific problem domain and development environment at hand. But some of this seems to indicate that some people just are better at this than others. </p>
