</ul><a id="examplersdimu"/><h2 id="example-rsdimu-">2.2 Example (RSDIMU)</h2><p>Some years ago, I worked on a series of research projects that made use of a Requirements Definition written by a NASA contractor, Charles Rivers Analytics. An updated copy of that document can be found <a href="../../Protected/references/rsdimuReqtsDefinition.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <p>It describes a Redundant Strapped-Down Inertial Measurement Unit, a device that forms part of an aircraft’s navigation system. It uses a bank of accelerometers (sensors that can measure acceleration along a straight line) to determine, at any moment in time, how much and in what direction the aircraft is accelerating.</p>
    <p>Integrated over time, the acceleration can yield the history of velocity changes by the aircraft. Integrated again, one can estimate how far and in what direction the aircraft has traveled.</p>
    <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="rsdimu-pyramid.png" style="float: right; max-width: 40%;"/></p>
    <p>Physically, the RSDIMU consists of a square-based pyramid with the triangular faces being equilateral triangles (a semi-octahedron).</p>
    <hr/><p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="rsdimu-sensors.png" style="float: right; max-width: 35%;"/></p>
    <p>On each triangular face are mounted two sensors, at right angles to each other.</p>
    <p>That gives a total of 8 sensors, all at varying angles to one another. That’s more than enough to determine the acceleration of the aircraft in 3 dimensions.</p>
    <p>This redundancy (the “R” in RSDIMU) is important because:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Over time, some sensors may fail,</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Redundancy means the system continues to function even after  multiple failures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like all physical measurement devices, the sensors are noisy –  there are random errors in any real measurement process.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Redundancy allows us to “average” together the readings to get a  more accurate estimate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><hr/><p>From the RSDIMU Requirements Definition:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>An RSDIMU consists of a skewed array of redundant inertial sensors and exemplifies the current trend for designing hardware fault tolerant inertial measurement units (IMU’s) for high reliability applications. The portion of the RSDIMU you will handle contains eight linear accelerometers mounted on the four triangular faces of a semioctahedron.</p>
    
  <p>Your procedure will have two functions, both of which are a consequence of the redundancy in the sensor complement of the RSDIMU. The first function is to perform a consistency check to detect and isolate failed sensors. The second is to use the sensors found to be good by the first check to provide estimates of the vehicle’s linear acceleration expressed as components along the north, east, and down axes of a navigational frame of reference.</p>
    
  <p><code>&#x22ee;</code></p>
    
  <p>an RSDIMU as described here would operate as follows. With the vehicle stationary, as series of sensor readings would be taken over time, and this would comprise the calibration data set for that particular flight. During flight, the sensors would be read periodically at regular time intervals to provide input for the navigation software.</p>
    
</blockquote><hr/><p><strong>Critique</strong></p>
    <p>The preceding requirements mix up functional and non-functional requirements and are incomplete.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Easy to criticise but hard to write good requirements definitions
    <ul>
      <li>Use of a standard format with pre-defined fields to be  filled means that information is less likely to be omitted</li>

    <blockquote>
  <p><strong>3. Physical structure:</strong></p>
    
  <p>The RSDIMU is composed of an instrument and a display. The display is discussed in Section 6.3. This section is devoted to the structure of the instrument package.</p>
    
  <p><strong>3.1</strong> The instrument package is a semi-octahedron (a square-based pyramid) (Figure 1).</p>
    
  <p><strong>3.1.1</strong> It has four non-base faces, named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, or <code>D</code>.</p>
    
  <p><strong>3.1.2</strong> Each face contains two sensors, named the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> sensors.</p>
    
  <p><strong>3.1.2.1</strong> Associated with each sensor is a set of misalignment  angles. These are specified further in Section 2.3.2.</p>
    
  <p><em>Rationale:</em> There is an ideal position for each sensor, but the  physical mounting may differ slightly.</p>
    
  <p><strong>3.1.2.2</strong> The misalignment angles are assumed to be small enough (less than 5 degrees) for the sine of the angle to be approximately equal to the value of the angle expressed in radians.</p>
    
  <p><strong>3.1.3</strong> The temperature of the face, <code>temp</code>, determines the temperatures of the sensors mounted on the face.</p>
    
  <p><em>Rationale:</em> Sensor output varies with temperature (see section 4.6).</p>

  <li>Invoking a function despite its pre-condition being false is  considered to be illegal and to have unpredictable results.</li>
  <li>Functions are not required to check their pre-conditions — the  pre-condition is an obligation on the caller, not on the  function being called.
    <ul>
      <li>Nonetheless, many programmers will add code to check  pre-conditions (if they can be checked without slowing the  function down) as a form of  <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs333/latest/Public/defensive/index.html">defensive programming</a>.</li>

</ul><p>Both pre-conditions and post-conditions must be boolean statements. </p>

</ul><p>Choose an organization that divides the requirements up into natural, easily understood groups.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Don’t choose to organize by user class, for example, if you have  only identified a single class or role for all users of the system.</li>
</ul><hr/><p>However it is organized, it must eventually describe</p>
    <ul>
  <li>every input into the system,</li>
  <li>every output from the system,</li>
  <li>all functions performed by the system</li>
</ul><hr/><p>All of these organizations observe strict separation of functional and non-functional requirements.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>In fact, the major difference among these organization is how the  functional requirements are arranged and grouped.</li>

      <li>Notice that attributes are listed separately, but we don’t list  functions but instead jump straight into requirements.</li>
      <li>That’s probably because many functional requirements will  express a relationship between multiple functions,
